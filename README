The following scripts are utility tools to help users perform
operations on C-grid variables.  The basic operations involve
calculating averages and gradients and these can be effectively
relegated to simple but useful scripts that can be called on
repeatedly to perform the requisite operations.  These scripts free
the user from worrying about implementation details and allow him/her
to focus instead on the larger picture.

There are 2 main scripts:
xop2_2d.m	Perform an operation along the x-direction
yop2_2d.m	Perform an operation along the y-direction
The others are either tests or printing scripts.  The script interfaces
were deliberately made simple so as to make their use easy.  The
scripts figure out automatically, using the array sizes as
indicators, if  the operations performed is from cell centers to
edges or vice versa. This simplicity has a price:
1. The arrays must be exactly sized as
     M    x  N      for p-variables
    (M+1) x  N      for u-variables
     M    x (N+1)   for v-variables
    (M+1) x (N+1)   for z-variables (vorticity defined at cell corners)
2. Operations from cell edges to cell centers visit all variables of 
   the output arrays.
3. Operations from cell centers to cell edges leave the boundary edges
   untouched. These must be given values using the problem's boundary conditions.


setmatrices.m   Sets up the matrices on a small C-grid for testing
prettyprint2.m  utility routine to print C-grid 1D variables in cgopstest.m
prettyprint4.m  utility routine to print C-grid 2D variables in cgopstest.m
printbars.m     utility routine to mark C-grid corners in cgopstest.m
cgopstest.m     The actual test of performing averages in the x and y-directions
		The input  arrays are fp,fu,fv,fz and are defined on p,u,v,z points
		The output arrays are gp,gu,gv,gz and are defined on p,u,v,z points
		The output arrays are initialed with the value -9.99 to highlight 
		"untouched" values.
